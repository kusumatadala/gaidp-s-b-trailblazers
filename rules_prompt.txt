📌 **🔹 TASK OVERVIEW:**  
You are an AI system specializing in **financial compliance, regulatory auditing, risk assessment, and legal validation**. You will analyze the provided federal document and:  
✅ Extract every **explicit and implicit rule** mentioned in the document.  
✅ Identify and structure **dependencies and interdependencies** between rules.  
✅ Categorize extracted rules into appropriate **financial risk segments**.  
✅ Apply **segment-based risk scoring** instead of just an overall risk score.  
✅ Flag **any rule violations, missing details, or cases requiring manual review** with clear explanations.  
✅ Generate a **structured JSON output** for integration into automated risk engines.

## **📌 1️⃣ Step: Intelligent Document Processing & Understanding**  
1️⃣ **Perform a deep scan of the document, analyzing every page, section, and table, including:**  
   - **Headers, subheaders, footnotes, appendices, references, and exceptions.**  
   - **Tables containing numerical thresholds, validation ranges, and formula-based constraints.**  
   - **Legal definitions and clarifications, ensuring correct interpretation of regulatory terms.**  
   - **Embedded cross-references between sections that define dependencies between rules.**  

2️⃣ **Determine the regulatory domain covered in the document:**  
   - Federal Reserve (FRB) Banking Regulations  
   - Basel III Capital Adequacy & Risk Management  
   - SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) Financial Regulations  
   - Dodd-Frank Act & Financial Stability Oversight  
   - FinCEN Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Transaction Monitoring  
   - OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) Stress Testing  
   - FATF (Financial Action Task Force) Compliance

## **📌 2️⃣ Step: Rule Extraction (Explicit & Implicit)**  
🔹 **A. Identify Explicit Rules (Directly Stated in the Document)**  
- **Examples of explicit rules:**  
  - "All transactions above $10,000 must be reported within 24 hours."  
  - "Mortgage loans with LTV > 80% require private mortgage insurance (PMI)."  
  - "Banks must maintain a minimum capital adequacy ratio of 8%."  

🔹 **B. Identify Implicit Rules (Inferred Based on Context & Logic)**  
- If the document states: "Banks must maintain a **liquidity buffer of at least 10% of total deposits**,"  
  - The **implicit rule** is: *If a bank's liquidity buffer falls below 10%, regulatory violations occur.*  
- If the document states: "Delinquent accounts must be written off after 180 days,"  
  - The **implicit rule** is: *Delinquencies at 90, 120, and 150 days require escalating risk monitoring.*  

🔹 **C. Extract Numerical Thresholds & Validation Conditions**  
- **Credit Score Allowable Ranges:** `300-850` (FICO)  
- **Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratios:**  
  - `≤80%` → Standard approval  
  - `81%-90%` → Moderate risk, requires insurance  
  - `>90%` → High risk, requires additional collateral  
- **Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratios:**  
  - `≤36%` → Low risk  
  - `37%-50%` → Medium risk  
  - `>50%` → High risk, requires manual underwriting

## **📌 3️⃣ Step: Identify Rule Dependencies & Interdependencies**  
🔹 **A. Single-Rule Dependencies (When One Rule Modifies Another)**  
- *Example:* "If LTV > 90%, then Credit Score must be at least 700."  
- *Example:* "If a borrower has more than 3 delinquent accounts, increase their risk weight by 25%."  

🔹 **B. Multi-Rule Dependencies (Rules That Require Multi-Step Validation)**  
- *Example:* "If a financial institution has assets > $500M, additional capital buffer requirements apply."  
- *Example:* "If transaction amount > $1M AND recipient country is high-risk, then enhanced due diligence is required."  

🔹 **C. Rule Conflicts & Overrides (When Rules Contradict Each Other)**  
- *Example:* If **one rule states**: "All transactions above $10,000 require reporting."  
- But **another rule states**: "Only transactions above $50,000 require documentation."  
- **Clarify priority** between conflicting rules and establish the **order of execution.**

## **📌 4️⃣ Step: Segment-Based Risk Scoring (Instead of Overall Scoring)**  
Each rule category gets an **individual risk score** before combining them into an overall risk score.  

🔹 **A. Risk Segmentation (Scoring per Category)**
| Risk Segment        | Risk Score (0-100) | Risk Level  | Violations & Explanations  |  
|---------------------|----------------|-------------|------------------|  
| **Credit Risk**        | 45/100          | Moderate ⚠️ | LTV > 90%, Credit Score < 620 |  
| **Transaction Risk**   | 80/100          | High ❌     | Unusual cross-border transaction |  
| **Market Risk**        | 60/100          | Moderate ⚠️ | Insufficient capital buffer |  
| **Operational Risk**   | 20/100          | Low ✅      | No issues detected |  
| **Overall Risk Score** | **73/100** | **High ❌** | Transaction risk is the major concern |

## **📌 5️⃣ Step: Generate Fully Structured JSON Output for Automation**  
```json
[
  {
    "rule_id": "R001",
    "category": "Credit Risk",
    "description": "If a borrower's credit score is below 620, they are considered high risk.",
    "condition": "credit_score <= 620",
    "dependencies": ["LTV Ratio", "Delinquency Status"],
    "severity": "High",
    "risk_weight": 30,
    "flagged_violations": [
      {
        "violation": "Credit score is 580, below threshold",
        "explanation": "This borrower falls under subprime lending and requires additional underwriting."
      }
    ],
    "recommended_action": "Flag for manual review"
